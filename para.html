    <h1>Active transport</h1>

        In 1926, Dennis Robert Hoagland investigated the ability of plants to absorb salts against a concentration gradient and discovered the dependence of nutrient absorption and translocation on metabolic energy using innovative model systems under controlled experimental conditions.[3]

        One category of cotransporters that is especially prominent in research regarding diabetes treatment[6] is sodium-glucose cotransporters. <br> These transporters were discovered by scientists at the National Health Institute.[7] These scientists had noticed a discrepancy in the absorption of glucose at different points in the kidney tubule of a rat. The gene was then discovered for intestinal glucose transport protein and linked to these membrane sodium glucose cotransport systems. The first of these membrane transport proteins was named SGLT1 followed by the discovery of SGLT2.[7] Robert Krane also played a prominent role in this field.
